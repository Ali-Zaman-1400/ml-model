# Machine Learning Model Examples

This repository contains sample **machine learning projects** built with Python.  
It demonstrates how to preprocess datasets, train models, and evaluate performance.  

---

##  Features
- Train simple ML models (classification, regression)  
- Use deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- Preprocess and normalize datasets  
- Evaluate model accuracy and loss  
- Save trained models for reuse

##  Project Structure

ml-model-examples/

├── train_mnist.py # Train a neural network on MNIST dataset

├── dataset/ # Example dataset (downloaded automatically)

└── saved_model/ # Trained model weights


---

##  How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow

2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_mnist.py

3. The model will train for a few epochs and report accuracy.

## Example Output
Epoch 1/3
1875/1875 [==============================] - 5s 2ms/step - loss: 0.2856 - accuracy: 0.92
Epoch 2/3
1875/1875 [==============================] - 4s 2ms/step - loss: 0.1405 - accuracy: 0.96
Epoch 3/3
1875/1875 [==============================] - 4s 2ms/step - loss: 0.1012 - accuracy: 0.97
 Test accuracy: 0.976
